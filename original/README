HELIX PACKING
Copyright ï¿½ 2002 University of Leeds 

There are three versions of the program: 

	a) c-helix (code in the file "chain_helix.c") - analyses the
	helices that are the present in a single specified protein chain.

	b) d-helix (code in "dom_helix.c") - analyses the helices that
	reside in a specified domain of a chain.

	c) a-helix (code in "all_helix.c") - takes into account all the
	helices in a protein (i.e. multiple chain analysis).

Other files required for the compilation and execution of the
algorithm(s), are:

	a) skew.h - for compilation of all programs.

	b) translation.txt - for execution of all programs.

	c) domlist.v2.4 - for execution of d-helix (can be obtained from
	the CATH website: http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/).

Input to the program is in the form of PDB and DSSP files. DSSP files are
produced from the PDB file using the DSSP program, obtained from the DSSP
website: http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/gv/dssp/. The algorithm is designed to
run interactively with the input file being chosen by the user. The input
file should contain a single PDB code at the start of each new line.
a-helix requires just the standard four character code, c-helix requires a
five character code which includes the PDB code plus the chain letter (the
chain is '0' if not specified otherwise), and d-helix requires a six
character code which is made up of the PDB code, the chain letter, and the
domain number (also '0' if not specified otherwise). The respective
program sequentially analyses all cases of helix packing in the designated
region of each protein in the input file.

Two example input files are:

	a) cath.txt - a short test file.

	b) Hreps.v2.4 - this is the latest CATH list of homologous
	super-family representatives (H-reps), obtained from the CATH
	website (The PDB codes in "Hreps.v2.4" are arranged into numerical
	and alphabetical order so as to avoid the analysis of the same
	protein twice).

The output files that are created by the algorithm are as follows
(brackets denote a difference between program versions):

	a) Helices.txt - contains general information on all helices of a
	single protein fold, such as first helix residue, last helix
	residue, helix length, helix sequence, and helix geometry type.
	The file also states the neighbouring and packed helix pairs,
	including the global angle, local angle, and the distance of
	closest approach. Also included is a full helix atomic list.

	b) Axis.txt - contains the local axis details, the local origin
	co-ordinates, the bending angles between successive axes, and the
	maximum bending angle for all the helices listed in "helices.txt".

	c) Geom.txt - contains a record of all the variables used in the
	helix geometry assessment. This includes the root mean square
	deviations of the best fit line and curve, the square of linear
	correlation coefficient, plus other information regarding the
	line/curve fitting process for each helix in "helices.txt".

	d) Contact.txt - contains the residue numbers that are involved in
	the interhelical contact for each helix pair in "helices.txt".

	e) Helix_packing_pair.txt - this is an appended file, i.e. it is
	extended along with each protein analysed, and contains all the
	variables that define the nature of each packed helix pair. All
	helix pairs of all the protein folds analysed are included. The
	information contained in the file is in tab delimited format and is as
	follows: protein fold identifier, first SSE (or helix) number,
	second SSE (or helix) number, (helix packing class), global angle,
	local angle, number of helix 1 contact residues, number of helix 2
	contact residues, distance of closest approach, number of
	interhelical covalent bonds, number of electrostatic interactions,
	number of H-bonds, and number of van der Waals.

	f) Helix_shape.txt - this is also an appended file and contains
	information regarding every individual helix that is involved in
	packing or not. The information contained is in a tab delimited
	format as follows: protein fold identifier, SSE (or helix) number,
	geometry type, and maximum bending angle.

In c-helix only, the helix numbering is converted into SSE (Secondary
Structural Element) numbering. The helix numbering designates the first
helix as zero, the second as one, and so on. SSE numbering also starts at
zero and not only contains helices, but also includes beta-strands and
unstructured regions. The unstructured sections of the chain include any
residue that does not have a secondary structure type of 'E', 'H', 'I', or
'G'.
